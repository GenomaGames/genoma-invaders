# Genoma Invaders - Unity Animation for 2D Games

This post explains **basic concepts about [Unity's Animation System (Mecanim)](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/AnimationOverview.html) to be used with 2D Games** and the use of triggers in animations to chain logic to them.

## Intro

Its time to provide enemies with some life and for that we are going to animate their movement using Unity's Animation System (sometimes called Mecanim). This animation system uses a [state machine system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) to control which animation it should be executing based on the conditions provided.
